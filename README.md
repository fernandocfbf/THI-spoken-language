# THI: Spoken and Natural Language Understanding
This repository aims to store the project from the NPL lectures of the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt Spoken and natural language understanding course 23.1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing field that focuses ondeveloping algorithms and models to enable computer to understand, interpret and generate human language. It has many practical applications in areas, such as language translation, chatbots and speech recognition. This project was born in the context of speech recognition, and was requested by a customer who dictates books. He is dissatisfied with the quality of the speech recognition application that he has. The idea is to design a entire Python system from scratch to improve the performance of the currently one. It will be done by creating a program that is capable of estimating a 2-gram language model, which will be explained in more details later. Furthermore, the customer provided samples of the books in text files, that are going to be used for training, validation and testing.
